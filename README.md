# TripHub

Users with upcoming vacation plans can manage their trips with TripHub. Through a Java/Spring Boot backend that interacts with a PostgreSQL database, users can save, revisit, edit, and delete their trip info stored in a web application built with React.

The backend is in the repo called "trip-hub-java" and can be found here: [https://github.com/chrisratsabout/trip-hub-java]

The video below demonstrates the CRUD functionality of this web application.
